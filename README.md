# domDiff
Identifies the difference between two given XML files preserving the DOM structure in the output.
This is meant as a straightforward utility not an actual module.

`domDiffsSample.js` - shows how to run this sample to compare two of the included XML files. 

More updates will be coming to refactor the code and move some of the features of the sample file into the code function of `domDiff.js`
